Hello, traveler!
Are you the one I heard about...?\nAh, nevermind.
It's good to see a new face around here. Good for business AND good for morale!

Hello, traveler.\nI hope your day is going well!
What? Why do I look so anxious? Well, um...
One of my items didn't make it on the last shipment. My guess is that the crate fell off somewhere.
It's a pretty important item, so if you find the crate please open it and bring the item back.
But no worries if you have better things to do! I understand.

Hello, traveler.\nI hope your day is going well!
I'm still worried about my lost item. Hopefully it'll show up on the next shipment...

Whoa! You found it?
Careful... That's an everglow lantern that was lit over a decade ago by a famous mage!
Its flame will never die as long as the lantern remains closed. Thanks for finding it!
...
Well, um... If you want to know, I'll tell you why this lantern is so important to me.
I think the famous mage who lit it was my grandfather. He left my family to pursue his career.
...But he was always nice to me when I was a kid. So I wanted something to remember him by.
Even if someone abandons you, you don't have to abandon your good memories of them.
At least, that's what I think.

If you need something, let me know. I've got plenty of gear if you're looking to buy!
And thanks again for finding my grandfather's lantern. I really appreciate it.
