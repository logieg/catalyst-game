#greeting

Hi!
Ooh, I heard about you. But don't worry, those mistakes are behind you, right?
If you're still sad about what happened, maybe my flowers will cheer you up!

Hi again!
Have you seen how well the tulips are blooming? The daffodils are looking bright too!
Y'know, if you ever find some pretty flowers out in the forest, my garden always has room!
Or keep them for yourself! Flowers make me happy, and I hope they help you too.

Can I have it? Pleeeease?

You'll let me have it? Really?

Nothing like a little color and beauty to remind everyone things will get better...

Hi again!
Your flower is growing well! I think it's prettier than all the others.
...But maybe that's just because you gave it to me!
