#greeting

Hey hey!
Are you that fella who got cast out from the warrior's guild?
...
I mean, you seem nice either way! I was just curious.

Hey hey!
Could I ask you something, fella?\nI know you're busy, but... well...
I lost my house key.
Could you, um, see if you can help me find it? Please?
I've looked all over the roof and it's not here. If you can help I'd be so grateful!

#searching

Hey hey!
Did you find the house key? No? That's fine, I'm sure it'll turn up. Hopefully...
My cat's probably starving by now...

#findkey

Hm?\nThere's a metalic glint under the bush.
It looks like a small door key.\nMaybe it's the key that was lost?

Oh! You found it!
Thank you so much! I can finally feed my cat!
Poor thing has been stuck inside all day while I've made a fool of myself losing something so important.

Hey hey!
Thanks again for finding my key, fella! Nobody else thought it was worth their time.
My cat could have starved if it weren't for you, and she's my little ray of sunshine in these dark times.
So... I mean it when I say you have my sincerest gratitude.
