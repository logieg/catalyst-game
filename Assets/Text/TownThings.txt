#lostcrate
It's a shipping crate, nailed shut. Probably shouldn't mess with it.

#findcrate

As the trader asked, you pry open the crate and find a strange purple lantern.
It glows with magical energy as you pull it out and take it with you.

#flowersearch

In the small patch of flowers, a bright blue tulip catches your eye.
You smile and take it with you, feeling a small tinge of hope.
