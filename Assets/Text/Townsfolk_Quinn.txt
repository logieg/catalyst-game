#greeting

Howdy!
It's about time we had another free spirit in town!
I'm the local unassuming mage, so feel free to ask me if you need magic advice.
...I know, I know. I don't look like a powerful mage at all.
Where's the wizard's cap and thick cloak, right?
Here's what they don't tell ya: Magic doesn't care what you look like!
You can be just as magical no matter how others see you. How cool is that?

Howdy!
Here for some magic tips, maybe? Don't worry, I know just about everything.
You see that floating board down there, with the purple levitation enchantments?
I made that! Didn't even take me a day!
...That's probably why it can't stay in one place, actually. Hmm...

Hey, um... I saw how you helped the trader down there.
That was really nice of you.
I actually knew the owner of that lantern back at the magic academy.
He taught my class on chemical transmutation. Old guy, but very friendly.
He really wished he wasn't so busy so he could reconnect with his family again.
It's always sad when fame and responsibility hold us back, huh?
